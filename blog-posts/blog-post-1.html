        <p><h1>My first blogpost, wow.</h1><br>
        Okay, so...I'm totally new to this kind of thing, and I don't even really know what to put here.<br>
        I'll try to keep it to important things primarily...But I wont let that stop me from posting some funny stuff.<br>
        Like I said on my Links-page, I'm not very social. But I'll try to keep active. This website is gonne need active maintinance anyway, if im really gonna work in WebDev.<br>
        Right now, I'm honestly just happy that this works at all. I made this all with REALLY rusty knowledge of HTML. So the fact that any of this works at all is mindblowing to me.<br>
        Hopefully soon, I'll be able to make some Javascript for this site, to make writing blogposts like these a little easier.<br>
        Right now, I have to make a new html file, and tell the blogs page to point to that file. which obviously doesnt really work very well.<br>
        And if I want to be able to do it right, I need to be able to automate some tasks regarding that. So I can focus on just adding blog-posts.<br>
        Don't worry, I'll try to update other parts of my website where needed.<br>
        I just don't wanna have to update multiple files if I just want to make a new blogpost. Besides that, keeping a blog in raw HTML is not very fun...<br>
        <br>
        Seeing as it is almost christmas. I'll wish you all a merry christmas in advance, I dont think I will update the blog agian this year...and thanks for reading. Means a lot to me ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ</p>

      <p><h3>🎂IT MUH CAKE DAY🎂</h3><br />
      Yeah, I don't really know what else to put here. I'm 23 years old as of today.<br />
      I'm normally not a big fan of celebrating my birthday, but for some reason I'm pretty excited about today.<br />
      If you are reading this, then you are likely one of my closer friends, unless you're just a stranger on the internet that looked at my discord about me and clicked on the funny website link...<br />
      If you are one of my friends, You should totally buy me games on steam😏.<br />
      This is a joke, all I really care about is that you even took the time to get here. Shoutouts to those friends who already shot me a DM though! ❤️<br />
      <strike>Gifts are still very much welcome though</strike><br />
      Anyway, that is all for this blogpost. Hope you have a lovely day!</p>

      <p>I often find myself longing for the love of another. Someone who will hold me dear...Someone who will make me feel better in case im ever down...<br />
    And I found that person not too long ago. But things got rocky...I ended things thinking it would make it better for them. Not realizing it would ruin me.<br />
   I am not okay right now. I have tasted the sweet nectar of true love and took it for granted, only to push it away and lose my sanity in the process.<br />
    I was blind. And now I'm broken. and for once, actually ready to give up..<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Now more than ever, I wish i could turn back time. To when I still had that shoulder to lean on. That shoulder now belongs to someone else.<br />
    I was a fool to think I would manage. I've failed myself, and all my loved ones.<br />
    I don't know how to fix it.<br />
    I am sorry.</p>

        Yeah...<br />
        So Last year wasn't great...With all the big hits in the guts I've had, and letting go of an angel...<br />
        Safe to say I haven't done very well this year. It was truly one of the wildest years I've had in a while.<br /><br />
        But, on the bright side, I've also learned a lot about myself. For example, I learned that I am NOT in fact aromantic. Rather, I kinda depend on a reliable source of mutual love in order to be happy. <br />
        I've also learned that I dislike the idea of Polyamory. I want a true relationship with someone who is truly dedicated to me, and I want to dedicate myself to someone that I can depend on.<br />
        I don't think I am ready to start something new yet, though. I am scared to get hurt, so fast after a breakdown. Because, let me tell you, my last breakdown was a heavy one. I didn't think life was worth living anymore. That's how bad it was when I came home that day, and realized just how lonely I was feeling.<br /><br />
        I've been doing better, but if I'm gonna stay better. Some things need to change.<br />
        For starters, I'm officially changing my preferred calling name to Raven. But you can still call me Yuuki, or by my screen name "Riddim_GLiTCH", or "RDG" for short<br />
        I feel more comfortable with this name, it matches my style more.<br />
        I'm also gonna seek therapy. While I can't change how I feel, I can change how I handle these feelings. And there are many better ways to handle negative emotions than fucking beating myself up over it and telling myself its all my fault.<br />
        I wanna become a stronger person, someone who can deal better with sudden changes and negative blows. But the road to get there is gonna be long and hard<br />
        Its upsetting that I've met someone so amazing, but can't be with in a reasonable way. I'm gonna miss what I had with Sylvie. But I'm not gonna push them any further. If I truly love them, then I need to accept the fact that its over and just let go.<br /><br />
        For the rest of the year, I'm gonna work on self-improvements, as well as focus more on actually working on my projects instead of just slacking off, which was also a result of a lingering depression that never really left. Heartache gets under your skin like that.<br />
        I've already made up my mind on next years new-years Resolution: <b>ACTUALLY</b> fix myself.<br />
        Here's to hoping I actually become a better person.

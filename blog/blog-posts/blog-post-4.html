      <p>I am not gonna sugarcoat it, I've lost track.<br />
    With everything that is happening lately, All the hacks, Crowdstrike, Data Breaches, and controversies around the world (Including, but not limited to a lot of my favorite childhood content creators being alleged as Pedophiles, Big Game studios making absolutely backwards takes. And people just being randomly flamed for the tiniest of reasons...) I have honestly lost track of the world.<br />
    I am not the most mentally stable person, as you may probably know. And all of this chaos in the spaces I care so deeply for is not at all helping.<br />
    Also not helping is the fact that my moods have been swinging again, and my paranoia about losing one of my dearest friends is playing up again.<br />
    <br />
    I am genuinely starting to get lost around the world nowadays. There is just so much going on, I physically can't keep up. I feel like its making me physically ill at times.<br />
    I hardly sleep anymore, as my brain is working overtime, trying to make sense of what happened in the past few days. Its scaring me at times, and I want someone to lean on.<br />
    But, the person I would like to lean on is often busy or just straight up not online. Not that it would matter, as I would rather physically lean on them.<br />
    I also feel kinda guilty about this, as I feel like me trying to get their attention is bothering them, too. And I don't want to be a burden.<br />
    <br />
    I am honestly scared for the future, Everything that is going on right now is overwhelming already, and I don't know what to expect anymore. And I don't wanna be alone in all this...<br />
    I just wish everything would calm down. But maybe also that I could just go back to a time where none of it mattered to me. Before I was bothered by adulthood.<br />
    <br />
    To the person I want to lean on, I'm sure you are reading this: I'm sorry. But I miss you a lot, and I wish things could go back to how they used to be. Because having you gave me certanty in these uncertain times.<br />
    To everyone, including the above person: Because I am so overwhelmed, I am considering taking a break from the internet again, or at the very least limiting my access to it. So I can take some time to focus on things that matter. Maybe find some therapy to help me.</p>

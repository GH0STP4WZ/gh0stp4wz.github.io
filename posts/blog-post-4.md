I am not gonna sugarcoat it, I've lost track.

With everything that is happening lately, All the hacks, Crowdstrike, Data Breaches, and controversies around the world (Including, but not limited to a lot of my favorite childhood content creators being alleged as Pedophiles, Big Game studios making absolutely backwards takes. And people just being randomly flamed for the tiniest of reasons...) I have honestly lost track of the world.

I am not the most mentally stable person, as you may probably know. And all of this chaos in the spaces I care so deeply for is not at all helping.

Also not helping is the fact that my moods have been swinging again, and my paranoia about losing one of my dearest friends is playing up again.

I am genuinely starting to get lost around the world nowadays. There is just so much going on, I physically can't keep up. I feel like its making me physically ill at times.

I hardly sleep anymore, as my brain is working overtime, trying to make sense of what happened in the past few days. Its scaring me at times, and I want someone to lean on.

But, the person I would like to lean on is often busy or just straight up not online. Not that it would matter, as I would rather physically lean on them.

I also feel kinda guilty about this, as I feel like me trying to get their attention is bothering them, too. And I don't want to be a burden.

I am honestly scared for the future, Everything that is going on right now is overwhelming already, and I don't know what to expect anymore. And I don't wanna be alone in all this...

I just wish everything would calm down. But maybe also that I could just go back to a time where none of it mattered to me. Before I was bothered by adulthood.

To the person I want to lean on, I'm sure you are reading this: I'm sorry. But I miss you a lot, and I wish things could go back to how they used to be. Because having you gave me certanty in these uncertain times.

To everyone, including the above person: Because I am so overwhelmed, I am considering taking a break from the internet again, or at the very least limiting my access to it. So I can take some time to focus on things that matter. Maybe find some therapy to help me.

I often find myself longing for the love of another. Someone who will hold me dear...Someone who will make me feel better in case im ever down...

And I found that person not too long ago. But things got rocky...I ended things thinking it would make it better for them. Not realizing it would ruin me.

I am not okay right now. I have tasted the sweet nectar of true love and took it for granted, only to push it away and lose my sanity in the process.

I was blind. And now I'm broken. and for once, actually ready to give up..

Now more than ever, I wish i could turn back time. To when I still had that shoulder to lean on. That shoulder now belongs to someone else.

I was a fool to think I would manage. I've failed myself, and all my loved ones.

I don't know how to fix it.

I am sorry.

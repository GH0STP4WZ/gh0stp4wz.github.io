# My first blogpost, wow.

Okay, so...I'm totally new to this kind of thing, and I don't even really know what to put here.

I'll try to keep it to important things primarily...But I wont let that stop me from posting some funny stuff.

Like I said on my Links-page, I'm not very social. But I'll try to keep active. This website is gonne need active maintinance anyway, if im really gonna work in WebDev.

Right now, I'm honestly just happy that this works at all. I made this all with REALLY rusty knowledge of HTML. So the fact that any of this works at all is mindblowing to me.

Hopefully soon, I'll be able to make some Javascript for this site, to make writing blogposts like these a little easier.

Right now, I have to make a new html file, and tell the blogs page to point to that file. which obviously doesnt really work very well.

And if I want to be able to do it right, I need to be able to automate some tasks regarding that. So I can focus on just adding blog-posts.

Don't worry, I'll try to update other parts of my website where needed.

I just don't wanna have to update multiple files if I just want to make a new blogpost. Besides that, keeping a blog in raw HTML is not very fun...

Seeing as it is almost christmas. I'll wish you all a merry christmas in advance, I dont think I will update the blog agian this year...and thanks for reading. Means a lot to me ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ

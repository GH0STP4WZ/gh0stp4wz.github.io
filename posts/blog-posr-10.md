# The Switch 2
 
Before anything, let me start off by saying that I will be trying to get one tomorrow. I've taken a day off of work to be able to stake out at our tech store so I can be one of the first to buy one. (Yes, I missed my Pre-Order Window).

I am aware of the [`ðŸ”—many controversies regarding the Switch 2`](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1k518dn/comment/moefv5p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). A lot of my friends are very keen to remind me that [`ðŸ”—Nintendo will gladly brick your system if you try to hack it`](https://www.themirror.com/tech/gaming/nintendo-brick-your-switch-2-1148906), And to that I only have one thing to say: Do it. I Can, and I will sue for damages. Here in europe, there are laws that go over general consumers rights. Specifically how as owners of hardware are entitled to do whatever they want to said hardware, within legal boundaries offcourse. It would be illegal if I hacked my switch to use it to hack the goverment offcourse. See [`ðŸ”—Directive 2009/24/EC - EUR-Lex`](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2009/24/oj/eng) for the actual legal definition.

TL;DR: Nintendo can't do ***SHIT***. They can only ban me from playing online if I actually go in and **cheat**. Literally, if I wanted to play Mario Kart World, but I wanted to replace bowser with Ganondorf for Example, I am legally protected to do this! As long as I don't use my ability to mod the game for nefarious reasons, European Consumer Law protects me from nintendo killing my switch 2 if I do mod it.


### But whats the big deal?
There are a few reasons why nintendo thinks they have the right to go this far, and all of them prove that they have lost sight of the company they once were: A gaming company, for the gamers.

1. They want to protect their Intelectual Property</br>
I have no argument against this, This is a completely valid thing to do, but I believe they are taking it too far sometimes, issueing LEGAL ACTIONS agains fan-made projects. Against people that make cool stuff around a franchise they like, because they like it and want to contribute their take on the franchise to the world. (Pokemon Gamma Emerald is a GREAT example of this a passionate fan of a nintendo franchise offering their, very well done, take on the franchise.)
2. They want to ensure sales of their consoles</br>
I can also not see an issue with this reasoning, How are you supposed to make money if you have no income? Though I would once again like to urge nintendo to leave reverse-engineering and fan-content alone -- Its just fans enjoying your stuff, and youre shitting on them.
3. They are scared of competition</br>
Probably not the bst way to explain it, but...I mean just look at palworld. The only reason they sued is cuz the concept came close to pokemon, and while I do agree in some parts that its very clearly *inspired by* pokemon, its also VERY VERY far away from the actual concept of pokemon. Its waaaay more like rust in that regard. But honestly, if youre scared of competition, nintendo, Why dont you actually put effort in making good games? I dont think the world is reado for another Scarlet and Violet incident...*Wait wasn't Legends A-Z shaping up to be even worse*...?</br>
I digress, point is, modern nintendo games, especially Pokemon games, which mind you, was my childhood, so it hurts a lot to see it in its current state, are falling off. To the point that me and my friend [`@EnkDev`](https://enkdev.xyz), who also grew up on pokemon, really do not care for modern pokemon anymore. We both agree that the NDS games were pokemon at its best -- Though we cant really agree on which; They prefer Gen 4, while I am a huge fan of 5. Nintendo, please make games like those again, instead of the slop you are putting out now.
4. Hackers</br>
Okay, im not gonna wrap any ribbons around it, the definition of hacking is a bit vague here. So to clarify, by hacking ***I*** mean the act of people tinkering with their consoles. Even if its just to put a wallpaper on the homescreen, nintendo wants none of that. Because they see any kind of tinkering as gaining an unfair advantage. And to thay, I wanna say to nintendo: ***GROW THE FUCK UP***. ITS A FUCKING WALLPAPER, A GOD DAHMN PNG. What do you mean I cant customize ***MY OWN*** console? Now, to be fair, A soft-modded console does allow the user to actually gain an unfair advantage, but as I said above, banning for cosmetic mods is a protected right for European Citizens. If I Want to Catppuccin-ify my console, an act that clearly will not give me any advantage in any game, Nintendo should not be allowed to ban me for it. It affects ZERO people, and just makes my console look prettier for me.

Remember when nintendo actually made good games?</br>
Remember when sakurai said that jailbreaking a 3DS was super easy?</br>
***Remember when Nintendo was Cool***?

### So What are you gonna do with your Switch 2 then?

Remember when I said nintendo doesnt make good games anymore? I kinda lied. Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom were both BANGERS of video games. Probably the only ones I like to play on my switch anymore. So with that said, I will
- Replay both Breath of The Wild and Tears of The Kingdom, but with the enhancement patches for the Switch 2.
- Hack it (duh)
- Honestly, I wanna put Linux on it. If the performance rumors are to be belived, this thing will be a Linux BEAST.


All this isn't to say I'm cool with nintendo being very anti-consumer for no real reason, by the way. I still want them to fix that.<br>
But, I feel like I have every right to still enjoy some of the cool things they do still. Maybe in ways Nintendo doesn't like, but thats never stopped me. (I still emulate switch games lol)


Thats it for now. If for whatever reason you enjoyed my rant about nintendo and the switch 2, then I thank you for your time in reading this. And if you didnt...well, I don't know. 

*Adios*~

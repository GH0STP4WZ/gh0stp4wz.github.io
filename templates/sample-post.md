# My New Blog System

I finally set up a better way to write blog posts! No more manual HTML editing for every post.

Now I can write my posts in Markdown, which is so much easier than writing raw HTML. This means I can focus more on the content and less on the code.

## What's changed?

- I'm writing in Markdown instead of HTML
- Posts are automatically generated
- The blog index is automatically updated
- I can add metadata easily with frontmatter

This is going to make maintaining my blog so much easier, and hopefully I'll be able to post more often now that the technical barriers are lower.

## What's next?

I'm thinking about adding more features like:
- Tags for posts
- A search function
- Comments section

But for now, I'm just happy that the basics are working well!
